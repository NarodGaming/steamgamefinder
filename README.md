# Narod's Steam Game Finder
A C# library compatible back to Windows 7 (.NET 3.5 edition) & modern .NET platforms (.NET 8.0 edition), which finds Steam and Games.

## Summary
This library allows you to check if Steam is installed, the Steam install path, the Steam library paths, and locate game install directories.

## Which edition should I use?
If you use the Nuget package manager, the versions are handled automatically for you - no further action required. The two versions behave identically regardless.

For .NET 8.0+ users, use SteamGameFinder2.dll

For .NET 3.5+ users, use SteamGameFinder.dll

## Usage
[Use the wiki](https://github.com/NarodGaming/steamgamefinder/wiki), it's comprehensive in explaining each function, exceptions, arguments, and so on. Code examples are in C# & VB.NET

## Further Help
You can find the 'TestApp' solution in this repository which has an example of how to use the library.
